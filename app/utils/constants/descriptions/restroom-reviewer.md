Finding a clean, accessible public restroom in an unfamiliar area is a surprisingly common frustration. Existing map applications show restroom locations but offer no insight into quality, cleanliness, or amenities, leaving users to discover poor conditions only after arriving.

I developed a full-stack web application that addressed this gap by combining location discovery with community-driven reviews. Users could browse an **interactive Google Maps interface** to find nearby restrooms, read reviews from other users, and submit their own ratings covering cleanliness, accessibility, and overall experience. The platform supported full **user authentication** with registration and login, allowing reviewers to build a profile history.

The front end was built with Vue 3 using a component-driven architecture, while the back end ran on Node.js with Express providing a RESTful API layer backed by MySQL. I integrated the **Google Maps JavaScript API** for map rendering and geocoding, implemented **session-based authentication** for secure user management, and built an **admin dashboard** that provided user moderation tools and oversight of submitted restroom entries and reviews. The database schema was designed to support relational queries across users, locations, and reviews efficiently.

This project showcases full-stack development across a modern JavaScript stack, demonstrating competence with third-party API integration, relational data modeling, authentication workflows, and role-based access control.
