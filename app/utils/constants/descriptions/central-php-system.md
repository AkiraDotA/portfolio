This monorepo serves as the backbone of the entire digital ecosystem, powering everything from e-commerce and content management to LMS delivery and administrative tooling. As the longest-running project I contributed to, it required working across a sprawling PHP codebase spanning CodeIgniter 3, Symfony 6, and Moodle while coordinating changes that rippled across the platform.

My contributions touched nearly every domain in the system. On the e-commerce side, I built eBook refund eligibility logic, transaction lookup pages, and Braintree payment error handling. Within the LMS, I helped develop the **base course copy feature**, a multi-month initiative enabling bulk assignment copying with due date retention, gradebook ordering, and parent course support. I maintained the **cloze question engine**, adding financial formula support for PV, PMT, and SQRT functions along with formula evaluation scoping and percentage formatting. I also built the **OfficeJS integration layer** enabling communication between the platform and Excel add-ins through postMessage-based event handling.

The technical breadth extended to **Freshdesk API** ticket management, **Pipedrive CRM** integration, academic email validation, Redis caching with serialization improvements, Docker configuration, and ECS scaling for production infrastructure. I replaced a legacy academic email validation library with a custom school list lookup, performed a **comprehensive Moodle accessibility audit**, and contributed to the ongoing **Symfony DDD migration** within the legacy codebase.

This project represents sustained, high-impact contributions across a complex backend system, demonstrating the ability to operate effectively across multiple frameworks, domains, and layers of infrastructure.
