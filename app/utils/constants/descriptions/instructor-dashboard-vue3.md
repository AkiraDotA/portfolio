The original instructor dashboard had been built on Vue 2 with Vue CLI, Vuex, and CoreUI Pro. As that ecosystem approached end-of-life and the application's complexity grew, a ground-up migration to a modern Vue 3 stack was needed to ensure long-term maintainability and unlock newer development patterns.

I led this migration as the primary developer, rebuilding every major feature from scratch in a new Vue 3 project using Composition API, Pinia for state management, Nuxt UI for the component library, and Tailwind CSS for styling. The scope covered the full application surface: the books dashboard with **draggable sorting and course archiving**, a sidebar and header with notification dropdowns, a complete request help system with nine individual ticket topic components, an account profile section with **image upload and Zod schema validation**, a notification system with full CRUD operations and a dedicated Pinia store, an integrations system with **lazy-loaded data and visibility tracking**, and a book catalog with search and subject filtering.

The architectural decisions centered on building a composable-driven codebase. I created composables for API fetching with store integration, active course management, breakpoint detection, form state with reset functionality, and loading debounce. All forms used **Zod schemas** for validation, replacing the manual validation approach from the Vue 2 version. I replaced vue-resource HTTP calls with VueUse's **useFetch** and built a centralized API client. State persistence shifted from vuex-persist to pinia-plugin-persistedstate. I also set up the CI/CD pipeline with PR deploy workflows and CDN placeholder replacement for staging and production environments.

This migration is my single largest body of work and represents a complete modernization of the predecessor Vue 2 instructor dashboard, demonstrating my ability to architect and execute a full-scale application rebuild while adopting modern tooling across every layer of the stack.
