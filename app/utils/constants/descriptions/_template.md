Brief opening sentence that frames what the project is and why it exists.

Expand on the core problem being solved or the main goal of the project. Describe the scope — what the application does at a high level and who it serves.

Cover the technical approach: what was built, key architectural decisions, and any notable implementation details. Mention specific features that demonstrate complexity or craftsmanship, such as **dynamic form generation**, **real-time data syncing**, or **custom Excel ribbon integrations**.

Close with the current state, broader impact, or what the project demonstrates about your capabilities as a developer.

<!-- GUIDELINES
- Target ~150-250 words across all paragraphs
- Each blank line creates a new <p> tag in the rendered output
- Only **bold** is supported — no headings, lists, or other markdown
- Write in past-tense, professional tone matching existing summaries
- Keep paragraphs focused: one idea per paragraph
- Don't restate the summary — it's displayed directly above on the detail page

ANONYMIZATION (public-facing content):
- Do NOT name specific products, platform brands, or the employer/organization
- Do NOT reference repository paths or internal ticket IDs
- Use generic terms: "the platform", "the company", "the LMS", etc.
- Name concrete technologies and APIs (Vue, Office.js, Freshdesk) but not proprietary product names
