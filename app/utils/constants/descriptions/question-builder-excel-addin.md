Educators needed a way to author accounting exercises directly within the spreadsheet environment they were already comfortable with, then export those exercises in formats compatible with the LMS question engine. No existing tool bridged the gap between Excel-based content authoring and the platform's cloze question format.

I built this Excel add-in from the ground up using vanilla JavaScript with an **OOP class architecture**, organizing the codebase into dedicated classes for each question type, utility functions, table rendering, paragraph handling, and output generation. The add-in supports multiple question types including multiple choice, dropdown tables, compound journal entries, and if-statement inputs, with a color-coded cell tagging system that authors use to mark answer cells, tolerances, and formatting.

A major technical achievement was the **spreadsheet export and OfficeJS generation pipeline**, which converts tagged Excel workbooks into both HTML cloze output and standalone Excel files with data validation, sheet protection, and frozen rows. I integrated **@cortex-js/compute-engine** for formula simplification and drill-down, enabling the system to reduce complex Excel formulas to canonical forms for grading. The add-in handles **multi-sheet workbooks** supporting up to 20 tabs with correct formula offset handling, and generates **formula grading tables** that map author formulas to final cell positions. I also implemented inline styling extraction, spanning factor calculations, and currency formatting for international use.

The project demonstrates deep expertise in the Office.js API, advanced formula processing, and the ability to architect a substantial application in pure JavaScript without framework dependencies.
