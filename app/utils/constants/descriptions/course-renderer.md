The LMS needed a comprehensive frontend application to deliver course content, assignments, gradebooks, and administrative tools to both students and instructors. As the primary interface students and educators interact with daily, it required careful attention to usability, accessibility, and performance across a wide range of features.

I served as a primary contributor to this Vue 2 application, building foundational features and iterating on them over multiple years. My earliest work established the **widget-based course home page**, a drag-and-resize grid system where instructors can customize their dashboard layout with widgets for announcements, upcoming assignments, grades, and welcome content, complete with a **management modal** for configuring visibility, sizing, and layout resets. I also built the **last-accessed-page system**, which evolved through multiple refactors from an auto-redirect approach to a non-intrusive banner, with route-specific meta properties and masquerading detection.

Key features I developed include a **guided tour system** using Shepherd.js with multi-step progression, route-aware navigation waiting, and first-time access detection for both instructor and student perspectives. Steps supported a **conditional display mechanism** that skipped targets not present in the DOM, and completion state was tracked through a **dedicated backend API** I built in PHP/Symfony. I implemented **lazy loading with skeleton placeholders** for course layouts, **route-based role restrictions** that control navigation visibility by user role, and integrated **Online Excel via WOPI** to enable embedded spreadsheet exercises with auto-fullscreen behavior. I conducted a **comprehensive accessibility audit** spanning the full application, including student home, performance reports, section management, modals, and navigation, and built a reusable accessible BaseModal component to replace the existing modal library.

The project reflects sustained ownership of a production LMS frontend, combining feature development, performance optimization, and accessibility across a complex educational application.
