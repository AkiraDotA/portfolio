Educational publishers maintain large test banks of assessment questions in various formats, and the process of converting between those formats was manual, error-prone, and time-consuming. A reliable conversion tool was needed to bridge the gap between authoring formats and the platforms where assessments are delivered.

I created and maintained a Java desktop application that imported test banks from formats like **DOCX and Moodle XML**, parsed them into a structured intermediate representation for cloud storage, and exported them to multiple output formats including plain text, Moodle XML, and Excel. The application handled a range of question types, including multiple choice, essay, and T-account questions, each with their own parsing rules for formatting, answer extraction, and learning objective validation. A **question error-checking system** flagged issues like missing question bodies or learning objectives before export.

The most technically demanding aspect was faithfully preserving complex formatting during conversion. I built **table parsing with multi-level indentation detection**, cell justification derived from Word styles, and header border handling. For plain text exports where tables could not be represented natively, I integrated an **HTML-to-image conversion pipeline** using Html2image to render tables as embedded images. The application included a working book management system with recent selections, a file explorer for working directories, and a general settings view. I packaged the application as a standalone Windows executable using **Launch4j with a bundled JRE**, eliminating Java installation requirements for end users.

The project grew steadily over several years of active development, reflecting my ability to architect and maintain a desktop application that handles intricate document parsing, format conversion, and cross-platform distribution using JavaFX and Gradle.
