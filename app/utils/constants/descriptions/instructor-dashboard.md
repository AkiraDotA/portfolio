The platform needed a centralized web application where instructors could manage every aspect of their teaching workflow, from course setup and student management to LMS integrations and support tickets. The instructor dashboard became the primary interface for these tasks and one of the most complex applications in the platform's ecosystem.

I contributed extensively to the Vue 2 application over several years, delivering major features across the full scope of the dashboard. My first initiative was a **comprehensive accessibility audit** addressing contrast ratios, ARIA labels, landmark roles, and keyboard navigation, an effort I repeated in two additional rounds as new features were added. I led a **course section UI overhaul** that replaced the existing create and copy course flow with modal-based forms, responsive button layouts, and a unified SectionForm component. I also built a **multi-month ticket system rebuild** that introduced conditional form logic for nine distinct topic types, file attachments with drag-and-drop upload, and meeting scheduling integration through Calendly.

Beyond these headline features, I delivered date validation for assignments and sections, student list sorting with integration status and temporary access indicators, a course copy flow that retained section due dates, and **draggable course reordering**. Each feature involved coordinating frontend components with REST API endpoints, managing Vuex state, and ensuring the UI remained accessible. The application was built on Vue 2 with CoreUI Pro and Bootstrap, using vue-resource for HTTP and vuex-persist for session storage.

This dashboard represents my longest-running project and demonstrates sustained ownership of a large-scale single-page application, balancing feature development, accessibility compliance, and ongoing maintenance across years of active work.
