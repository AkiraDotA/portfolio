Students needed to complete accounting exercises within Excel itself rather than in a traditional web form, preserving access to Excel's formula capabilities while still enabling automated grading through the LMS. This add-in serves as the student-facing counterpart to the question builder, loading authored workbooks and providing an interactive answering and grading experience.

I built this add-in from scratch using Vue 3, Vuex, and Office.js, starting from a Yeoman generator scaffold and developing every layer, from Excel API integration and worksheet protection to LMS communication and formula validation. The core **"Check My Work" feature** provides real-time feedback by parsing student answers, comparing them against expected values, and generating visual cell-level indicators for correct, incorrect, and incomplete responses.

The most technically distinctive aspect is the **formula validation engine** powered by @cortex-js/compute-engine, which simplifies both the student's formula and the expected formula to canonical forms before comparison, ensuring that equivalent formulas like `=A1+A2` and `=SUM(A1:A2)` are recognized as correct. I built a **MessagingService singleton** for structured iframe communication with the LMS using postMessage events with acknowledgment patterns, implemented **cell cutting prevention** that restores formatting when students accidentally modify protected cells, and developed **multi-sheet support** with synchronized auto-saving across all tabs. The add-in also features an introduction carousel, guided help, and a review mode that unfreezes rows and displays answer reports.

The project showcases cross-platform Excel development with deep formula processing, real-time LMS integration, and thoughtful UX design for an educational context.
