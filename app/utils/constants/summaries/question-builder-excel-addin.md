Created an **accounting question builder Excel add-in** that granted the ability to tag and format Excel worksheets in such a way that would allow them to be parsed and converted into HTML output that could be used in the creation of Moodle cloze questions. Also developed new functionality in the question builder to allow the possibility to convert the entire Excel workbook into an Excel file format to be used in tandem with the **accounting question taker Excel add-in**.
