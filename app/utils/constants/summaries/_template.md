[Past-tense action verb] a [project type] [primary purpose/function], [key features or technical details that demonstrate scope and complexity].

<!-- GUIDELINES
- 1-2 sentences, single paragraph — no line breaks
- Open with a past-tense action verb: Developed, Created, Built, Designed, Implemented
  - Use "Designed and developed" when both UX decisions and code were owned
  - Use "Continuously maintaining" or "Revamping" only for ongoing/in-progress work
- Pack details into information-dense compound sentences using commas, participial phrases, and dependent clauses
- Describe WHAT was built and WHAT it does — not vague impact claims
- No buzzwords ("innovative", "cutting-edge"), no metrics ("increased X by Y%"), no emojis
- Can use **bold** sparingly to cross-reference related projects (rendered as <strong>)
- Name concrete technologies and APIs when relevant (Office.js, Google Maps API, shepherd.js)

ANONYMIZATION (public-facing content):
- Do NOT name specific products, platform brands, or the employer/organization
- Do NOT reference repository paths or internal ticket IDs
- Use generic terms: "the platform", "the company", "the LMS", etc.
- Name concrete technologies and APIs (Vue, Office.js, Freshdesk) but not proprietary product names
