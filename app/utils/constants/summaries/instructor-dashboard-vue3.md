Led the full architectural migration of the **instructor dashboard** from Vue 2 with Vue CLI, Vuex, and CoreUI Pro to Vue 3 with Composition API, Pinia, Nuxt UI, and Tailwind CSS, rebuilding every major feature from scratch as the primary developer. Implemented Zod schema validation across all forms, built a centralized API composable layer with VueUse, and reconstructed the ticket system, notification system, integrations, account profile, book catalog, and request materials flow with modern patterns including lazy loading and persisted state.
