Built a comprehensive Vue 2 web application serving as the primary instructor-facing interface for managing courses, students, assignments, LMS integrations, support tickets, and account settings, using CoreUI Pro and Bootstrap. Conducted three rounds of accessibility audits addressing contrast, ARIA labels, landmarks, and keyboard navigation, and delivered major features including a course section UI overhaul, a multi-month ticket system rebuild with conditional form logic and file attachments, and draggable course reordering.
